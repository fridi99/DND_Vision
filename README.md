## Table Top manipulation powered by hand tracking

The goal of this project is to create a Software that allows players of tabletop games to add Area of Effect stencils to projected battlemaps without needing additional hardware.
Hand tracking is used to allow players to place and size effects, through pinching gestures.

The DM, using the PC running the Software can interface with the software using the following keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| s   | Sphere |
| r   | Cube   |
| c   | Cone   |
| l   | line   |
| p   | pathing |
| n   | next map |
| q   | quit |

Follow these Steps to place the desired effect:
![place](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5590eb31-88c2-40b9-8e6a-9c6d4492a948)
with the back of your hand towards the camera and your index finger and thumb at a right angle, move the effect to its desired location, indicated by the green dot.
![pinch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bfe3daa-74a5-45fc-a28e-d1e55c091d90)
pinch your indexfinger and thumb together to place the effect at the spot and begin resizing, by moving your pinched fingers away from the center until the size is to your liking.
![release](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7436afa-4ea2-4f5b-b5fe-148795b39085)
when you are happy with the size unpinch your fingers, after a short time the effect will be placed and the program goes into standby.
The battlemap will loose saturation during the process, so the hand tracking is more reliable.
