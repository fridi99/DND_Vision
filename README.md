This Project aims to create a digital Battlemap system that uses gesture tracking to place Area of Effect markings for D&D and other Pen and Paper Roleplaying Games.
The Software right now is geared to service D&D and offers the most common Shapes used by spells.

For the physical setup either mount a beamer on top of your playtable or a screen on/inside. Mount a camera so it is aligned with either. Connect both to your device running the software.

If anyone ever wants to use this, please send me a message and I can create a guide on how to adjust the code for different table sizes.

use the following keys while focusing either picture to use the software
s: sphere
r: cube
c: cone
l: line
n: next map
k: calibration (unstable)
q: quit
